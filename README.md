# Dotfiles

This repo holds my dotfiles.

## Installation

Altough there is a installation script included in this repo, it is intended to
my own. It still might serve you but I'd rather recommend you to read through the
files and copy the bits you like.

If you do use the installation script, please update personal info such as email
options in:

* `lib/offlineimap/config.py`
* `msmtp/config`
* `offlineimap/config`
* `mutt/muttrc`
* directory/files under `mutt/accounts`

and user name and email in:

* `git/config`
